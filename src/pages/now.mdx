> So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

It's been a year since I finished my first degree in Statistics. It's a 
new life out here, and I think it's time for me to continue my
journey and start executing the plans I've had for a long time.

Here's the opportunity for me to start exploring and have fun with what I have be working on. 
I have to continue what I love doing, which is programming and trading the financial market, even if this is the risk that I'd be taking. These were the stuffs that brought me enough joy but I had to put a stop to it because I wasn't able to manage my time well which later it affected my academics. 
I have the time for me now to concentrate on myself.

## Things I plan to do.
1. Build my first SaaS product.
2. Going all in trading and treating it as a business.
3. Learning DevOps with this <a href = "https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp">Bootcamp</a>
4. Learn German (Will probably build a personal tool for that).
5. Start an IT training school.
6. Start saving.



## Things I am caring more about

It's human to experience a range of emotions. Happy to sad. Clarity to confusion. Loved to lonely. And it goes the other way around. Thoughts are just thoughts. When I find myself feeling low, I am learning now that I am not taking care of myself well. If I take care of my lifestyle: sleeptime, sunshine, journaling, eating right, etc, I will eventually be good.

Another is just to kick myself out of my negative thought patterns.

## Books
Back in high school, a friend introduced me to self-development books that I took seriously and that laid a solid foundation for my growth. 
However, as we all do at times, I found myself straying from the right path. 
Now, I’m determined to get back on track. Although I’ve read books like Rich Dad Poor Dad, Success Habits, and The Richest Man in Babylon, 
I plan to revisit them to relearn their valuable lessons and renew my focus.



1. **Success Habits** by *Napoleon Hill* - In Progress
2. **The Richest Man in Babylon** by *George S. Clason* - In Progress
3. **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by *Robert Kiyosaki*
4. **Awaken the Giant Within** by *Tony Robbins*
5. **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success** by *Deepak Chopra* - In Progress
6. **Think Like a Billionaire** by *Donald Trump*

So that's the gist of it. If something new comes up, I'll update this, and once completed, I'll strike it out.


## Goals that I will pursue in 2026

1. Passing a 100k Prop firm Account
2. Finding myself again (The serious guy i used to be)
3. Healthy & Good Lifestyle
4. Learning Cloud and DevOps
5. Spending more time with myself
6. Certifications in
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate</li>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate</li>
</ul>

You'll see if I listened to my own advice at the end of the year hopefully. 

Keep Learning , Keep Growing :)
