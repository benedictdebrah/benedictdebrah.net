> So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

I am 23 now, and life is starting to feel more serious—and honestly, a bit scary.
But the good news is that I’ve gotten my spark back.
By that, I mean I’m full of ideas and motivation to do something meaningful again.
Last year, during my national service, life was mostly about working and enjoying the moment. Everything felt routine—almost like my life was on autopilot, scheduled, and without clear direction. I’ve been praying to God for a change in my behavior and the way I live. I don’t know whether a new year truly comes with a transformed mind, or if my prayers are simply being answered—but something has shifted.

Should I consider unemployment a blessing? Maybe, yes.
I now have more time for myself—to learn from the people around me and to truly experience life. The only downside of unemployment, in my opinion, is brokenness.
I have a lot of plans, and I can feel myself again—the same version of me from 2021 and 2022. Even though life feels serious and scary right now, I’m grateful that my mind is focused on the things I want to accomplish.

If you feel the same way, don’t freak out. I believe all of this shall pass, and we will end up on the happier side.

It’s been a while since I wrote any code, and I feel very rusty at the moment. At the same time, I have this idea of what could be the next big thing. It’s funny how I tried to do everything “right,” yet still found it difficult to get a job because everyone is doing the same thing.
The field feels oversaturated. We’re all following the same path.
So now, I want to do something different—the odd path. Even if I have to start all over again, I don’t mind. Even if it’s a risk, I’m willing to take it. I finally have time to focus on myself.

I truly feel like this is a new beginning

## Things I plan to do.
1. Build my first SaaS product.
2. Going all in trading and treating it as a business.
3. Learn more about product development and marketing.
4. Start learning German.
5. Start an IT training school.
6. Work towards the new idea.
7. Start saving.
8. Healthy & Good Lifestyle
9. Get my driving License.
10. Passing a 100k Prop firm Account.



## Things I am caring more about

It's human to experience a range of emotions. Happy to sad. Clarity to confusion. Loved to lonely. And it goes the other way around. Thoughts are just thoughts. When I find myself feeling low, I am learning now that I am not taking care of myself well. If I take care of my lifestyle: sleeptime, sunshine, journaling, eating right, etc, I will eventually be good.

Another is just to kick myself out of my negative thought patterns.

## Books
Back in high school, a friend introduced me to self-development books that I took seriously and that laid a solid foundation for my growth. 
However, as we all do at times, I found myself straying from the right path. 
Now, I’m determined to get back on track. Although I’ve read books like Rich Dad Poor Dad, Success Habits, and The Richest Man in Babylon, 
I plan to revisit them to relearn their valuable lessons and renew my focus.



1. **Success Habits** by *Napoleon Hill* - In Progress
2. **The Richest Man in Babylon** by *George S. Clason* - In Progress
3. **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by *Robert Kiyosaki*
4. **Awaken the Giant Within** by *Tony Robbins*
5. **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success** by *Deepak Chopra* - In Progress
6. **Think Like a Billionaire** by *Donald Trump*

So that's the gist of it. If something new comes up, I'll update this, and once completed, I'll strike it out.


You'll see if I listened to my own advice at the end of the year hopefully. 

Keep Learning , Keep Growing :)
