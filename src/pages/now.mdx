> So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

It's been some months since I finished my first degree in Statistics. It's a 
new life out here, and I think it's time for me to continue my
journey and start executing the plans I've had for a long time.

Here's the opportunity for me to start exploring and have fun with what I have be working on. 
I have to continue what I love doing, which is programming and trading the financial market, even if this is the risk that I'd be taking. These were the stuffs that brought me enough joy but I had to put a stop to it because I wasn't able to manage my time well which later it affected my academics. 
I have the time for me now to concentrate on myself.

## What Iâ€™m currently doing
1. I am currently doing my NSS at HuriSoft as an AI Engineer . Working on one of our new projects.
2. Trading the financial markets
3. Learning DevOps with this <a href = "https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp">Bootcamp</a>
4. Tinkering with German (Will probably build a personal tool for that)

## What I'll be focusing on.

Mastering my strategy and trading the financial market.

To those who are new here . I used to trade and I was profitable (Just saying ðŸ˜„).

But I had to stop as stated earlier but I have still been learning and improving myself occasionally.
I came back to the charts on September and its been great , i mean everything is working out well as far as i can remember.
I might continue sharing my insights on tradingview if I see it's necessary for me to do so.


Update : I am doing pretty well on XAUUSD

## Things I am caring more about

It's human to experience a range of emotions. Happy to sad. Clarity to confusion. Loved to lonely. And it goes the other way around. Thoughts are just thoughts. When I find myself feeling low, I am learning now that I am not taking care of myself well. If I take care of my lifestyle: sleeptime, sunshine, journaling, eating right, etc, I will eventually be good.

Another is just to kick myself out of my negative thought patterns.

## Books
Back in high school, a friend introduced me to self-development books that I took seriously and that laid a solid foundation for my growth. 
However, as we all do at times, I found myself straying from the right path. 
Now, Iâ€™m determined to get back on track. Although Iâ€™ve read books like Rich Dad Poor Dad, Success Habits, and The Richest Man in Babylon, 
I plan to revisit them to relearn their valuable lessons and renew my focus.



1. **Success Habits** by *Napoleon Hill* - In Progress
2. **The Richest Man in Babylon** by *George S. Clason* - In Progress
3. **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by *Robert Kiyosaki*
4. **Awaken the Giant Within** by *Tony Robbins*
5. **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success** by *Deepak Chopra* - In Progress
6. **Think Like a Billionaire** by *Donald Trump*

So that's the gist of it. If something new comes up, I'll update this, and once completed, I'll strike it out.


## Goals that I will pursue in 2025

1. Passing a 100k Prop firm Account
2. Finding myself again (The serious guy i used to be)
3. Healthy & Good Lifestyle
4. Learning Cloud and DevOps
5. Spending more time with myself
6. Certifications in
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate</li>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate</li>
</ul>

You'll see if I listened to my own advice at the end of the year hopefully. 

Keep Learning , Keep Growing :)
