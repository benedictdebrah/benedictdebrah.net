This day reminds me of the time I got locked in, a moment that ultimately helped shape who I am today. I’m writing this as a memo for the next step I’m about to take in my life.

Over the past months, my energy and motivation to keep going have really been down.

Two weeks ago, I got in touch with one of my high school mates who's more like a brother—Kankam Yeboah. Before we lost touch, we used to call each other every month to check up on our growth. We're all in tech but different fields, so we were basically keeping each other accountable. It was going well until we lost contact, I think in my junior year or so. I tried reaching out but couldn't get hold of him, and school was already keeping me busy, so we lost contact until we finished our degrees at different universities.

I've always known there's this loss of motivation that's been affecting me, and I actually didn't know how or why it's happening. There was this feeling of relaxation and comfortability.

But I think as a sane person, you shouldn't have this feeling if you haven't achieved more than 50% of your goals.

One Friday, I went to the University of Ghana to attend a PyCon Africa program. It occurred to me that I really needed to get in touch with this guy because I had visited him once during our first year. So I looked him up on LinkedIn, and yeah, we got in touch. To keep everything short, my guy went **ghost** and really went hard on his craft, and he's currently doing very well.

The whole 3+ hour conversation got me **inspired and reminded me how good it is to sometimes escape the environment and do your own thing to achieve what you want in this era of distraction.** It was really a fun time moving from different platforms—Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Meet—because of internet connection issues. I felt the feeling I lost this past year: the energy and motivation that I needed. I'm really glad I got in touch with him.

And just watching this [podcast](https://youtu.be/2RqtCHIF6h0?si=I2wNbEyB-BmAnHN9) with **Tristan Dumas** and **Gabriel Nyarko**

****serves as the icing on the cake. I'm really inspired and motivated.

This may sound weird, but I think if you're reading this and you feel you're in your comfortable space without doing anything to achieve your goals, there's something wrong and you need to sit up and do something about it.

Overall, the lessons I learned:

1. Sometimes you need to disconnect yourself for your own purpose
2. Don't be too comfortable
3. Grind and you will see results
4. Never lose connection with someone who is contributing to your growth
5. The effort is never enough, and it never ends
6. There is no time to waste
7. Learning never ends

I'm really glad I've come to this realization. I believe I'll return to this post with good results and news.

Happy learning, keep growing
