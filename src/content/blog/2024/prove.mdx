I have always felt there's something wrong in we trying to prove things that don't matter.

How can we achieve perfection if we are trying to focus on things that don't matter?

However, my definition of perfection is being true to oneself, without pretenses or attempts to impress others. I believe that the most fulfilling aspect of life is not about showcasing one's identity, but rather about finding joy in one's pursuits.

Recently, I have come to realize that I have been trying to prove myself, much like many others. However, this approach shifts the focus from achieving goals to seeking validation.

What if our efforts go unrecognized or unappreciated? Will we cease to engage in activities that bring us joy? I think not.

This reminds me of Prof. Grigori Perelman when he said:

> If the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed.

To provide a bit of information about him, he dedicated his life to solving one of the most challenging problems in mathematics that had been set aside for years. However, he declined a million-dollar prize among other awards. These simple acts teach a lot about values (if you haven't seen it yet, try to read more about him).

To end, I think we should try and focus on engaging in activities that bring us joy, without seeking external approval. Our work will be our proof (and only prove when necessary), and any recognition we receive will be a bonus. By living in this manner, we will find true fulfillment and happiness and also reach the goal.
