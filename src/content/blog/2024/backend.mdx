Hey! So, I thought Iâ€™d turn this into a blog post and also share some personal notes on building with FastAPI from a beginnerâ€™s perspective.

Currently, Iâ€™m doing my national service. I went in as a data science guy, but after working for a while, I started feeling a bit confused and, honestly, bored. During one of our standups, I shared my thoughts about the role and mentioned that I wanted to explore other areas. The response I got was pretty supportive.

In short, I decided I wanted to get into software engineering, specifically backend development. I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to work on a new product (not started yet), focusing on the backend. The catch? I have zero backend experience, so itâ€™s basically going to be a learn-as-I-go situation.

Since Iâ€™m proficient in Python, we thought FastAPI would be a cool choice. Although I had some experience with FastAPIâ€”mainly building models and exposing them as API responsesâ€”I decided to learn more and really get my hands dirty. I wanted to learn backend development from scratch and understand the general flow of how things work in order to be ready for the project.

Thatâ€™s when I decided to build a project called DuhDuh. I honestly donâ€™t know why I chose that name, it just felt right (and kinda funny).

The goal of the project was to:

1. Understand how FastAPI works.
2. Learn how to structure backend code.
3. Integrate other tools with the code.
4. Handle authentication.
5. And, overall, just get my hands dirty.

Looking back, I can confidently say that this project taught me more than any YouTube tutorial I found. The real learning came from encountering errors and working through them myself.

So yeah, the project is:

DuhDuh-V2 is just a simple CRUD blog with authenticationðŸ˜‚. After building the first version, I realized I could make it better, so I went ahead and built V2 (and who knows, V3 might be coming).

Hereâ€™s the GitHub repo for the project: [DuhDuh-V2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/benedictdebrah/DuhDuh-V2)

Iâ€™m planning to work on more small backend projects to keep learning and experimenting with new concepts in the field of backend, and I hope to add backend development to my skillset at the end of my national service.
