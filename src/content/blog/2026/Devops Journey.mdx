Hello! I've decided to start blogging about my journey as I transition to a more cloud, DevOps, and AI-focused career. 
Previously, I worked as an AI engineer, but I want to deepen my knowledge of cloud development and cloud security and its relation to AI engineering. I believe adding these skills to my expertise will strengthen my career path.  

...

I’m excited about this journey, and I hope sharing my experiences will help others who are also transitioning into cloud and DevOps. Stay tuned for more updates! 🚀
