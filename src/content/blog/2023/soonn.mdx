Today, as I watch my friends graduate, I can’t help but think about my own path. We started this journey together, sharing good times and bad. Now, some of my seniors are moving abroad for further studies, and others have landed cool tech jobs as new graduates. I am really glad all their hard work was worth it. Even though this gives me hope, I feel like a failure because I couldn't achieve what I planned.

When I began studying statistics at KNUST in 2021, I had a plan: get a job in data science before graduating. I thought I had plenty of time, but now, as graduation approaches, I realize how quickly time has flown by.

This year was supposed to be the one where I got everything sorted out. I’ve put in a lot of effort and made sacrifices. But here I am, wondering if it was enough. I’ve made mistakes along the way, but I still feel like it’s not the end, even though I’m scared as I write this.

I failed three job interviews at the final stage—each one could have changed my life. My grades aren’t great either, something I’d rather not talk about. It feels like I’m losing on both fronts; career and academics. I also had a good chance in the financial market, but a personal breakdown stopped me. Was it discipline, or did I just give up?

I think it's discipline. With just a few years left here. I need to focus on my academics, which must be my priority now.

It's a great read and really inspiring.

Despite everything, I’m proud of what I’ve done so far. I believe I deserve better and can do better, but sometimes I worry I’m not ready. In a year, I’ll be out in the real world, and I’m scared I won’t be prepared if I don’t get out of this rut. I don’t want to blend in, I want to be different.

My dad tells me not to rush, but I know he’s quietly hoping for results. I have four months to make something happen before the year ends. I still have plans, and I still have hope.

This journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s not over yet. I’ve learned that setbacks are part of the process, and each failure brings me closer to success. I’m determined to push through these last few months with all I’ve got.

To my friends graduating today, congratulations! Your success inspires me to keep going. And to anyone who feels lost or behind, remember that the journey is important. We’re all on different paths, and our time will come.

As I look ahead, I remind myself that I’m not defined by my setbacks but by my perseverance. The year isn’t over yet, and neither is my story. I will make it happen.
