In today's saturated tech field, standing out can be challenging, especially during the interview process. As a student or someone yet to be hired, there are a few often overlooked actions that can make a big difference. In this post, I will discuss some small things you can do to set yourself apart in the tech field, focusing on interviews.

### Master Your Field and Build a Strong Portfolio

Firstly, focus on mastering your chosen field and building a strong portfolio, whether it’s in data science, software engineering, design, or any other area. Additionally, work on open-source projects to gain more real-world experience. Also, be willing to work for free; opportunities like these can lead to valuable rewards, such as payment in other forms, like a referral, as was the case for me.

It’s common for students to start applying for jobs once they feel they’ve acquired enough skills, but it’s important to remember that building a portfolio and gaining internship experience are equally crucial. My advice to students is to prioritize internships over full-time jobs because full-time work can be very tiring. Don’t underestimate the importance of your academic performance; some big companies consider it important to just to churn people out in my opinion. (Try to balance everything)

### Start Applying and Gain Interview Experience

Once you feel confident with your portfolio, start applying for jobs. The goal here isn’t just to land a job but to gain interview experience. The experience you gain from these interviews will help you in several ways:

1. **Understand the Stages of Interviews**: You’ll learn about the various stages of interviews, which can vary depending on the job but often follow similar patterns.
2. **Familiarize Yourself with Common Interview Questions**: Repeated interviews will make you more comfortable with the types of questions typically asked.
3. **Increase Your Confidence**: Confidence is crucial. Imagine attending an interview where everything feels new; repeated interviews help you prepare well.
4. **Clear Remote or Onsite Internship Interviews**: If you pursue internships differently from the traditional method of submitting letters to companies, these experiences will be invaluable.

### Personal Experience: Interview Journey

Allow me to share one of my interview experiences as an example. In my junior year at KNUST, around late February, I received an email from a recruiter about a data analyst role, which caught my interest as I had been working on upskilling in that field. Despite not being overly excited, I responded to the recruiter to gain more interview experience, even though I had received two rejections in the past three months—one from Bank of America (this was particularly heartbreaking as I had really prepared and was able to pass three rounds but failed at the final stage) and one from GuestReady, both in the UK.

We scheduled an initial video call where they asked about my experiences. Although I wasn’t fully invested, I did well enough to proceed to the next stage: a take-home project. The project involved analyzing survey data for an NGO sponsoring African nations, which I completed with enthusiasm, even skipping class to do so. I built a dashboard with insights and incorporated NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights from the unstructured survey data. I documented the process and submitted my work before the deadline.

After passing this stage, I had a meeting with the global manager of analytics. The conversation was pleasant, focusing on personal life, experiences, salary expectations, and the day-to-day aspects of the role. Despite feeling confident, I received a rejection letter due to competition from a more experienced candidate (I asked for feedback from the recruiter on my performance).

Although initially disheartened, this experience taught me valuable lessons and eventually led to other opportunities, including a role as a lead for Omdena Accra in 2023 and subsequent internship placements. Confidence played a significant role in my journey, transforming me from a reserved and shy individual to someone who believed in their capabilities and could confidently tell their story.

### Conclusion

Interview skills can be learned through experience, often the hard way, including making mistakes and learning from them. While tips you learn online can be helpful, experience teaches you how to navigate different situations and adapt to various interview styles. One strategy cannot be used for all interviews. For me, I learned the hard way. I sat down, wrote down my interview experiences, checked for repetitions and mistakes, and made sure to correct them.
