> Hi there! I am Benedict , a Data Scientist from Ghana and a big fan of AI/ML and finance. 
> I started this journey as a statistics major at the university, learning programming on my own as a passion, 
> which led me to different roles and my current position as a Data scientist.
> This blog is where I share my experiences, projects, and random thoughts. I'm not claiming to be an expert, 
> but I hope my stories and insights can inspire someone out there.

## Why I start this blog
I see myself as an Innovator and a regular person who loves generating ideas.

I'm an ideas guy and I love to share  what I know. I feel most alive when I'm creating or writing down something. What do I create? It could be a new product, a business idea, random thoughts, or something interesting.

I want to remember these creative moments for a long time. Whether they turned into actual projects or stayed as ideas, each is a special memory. Yes, I love working, and I want to remember these moments even when I'm older. That's why I started this blog.

## My Growth Stories

My skills are in statistics, machine learning, data science, and finance. But this blog won't just be about technical stuff. There's already a lot of great information out there. I don't see my insights as the final word.

Instead, I'll share anecdote thus lessons from my academic journey, work experiences, and the mix of successes and failures that shaped me. I'll talk about what has influenced my thoughts and feelings over the years.
Especially if there are stories that only I know, I'll share them here. It would be great to add some emotion in this often impersonal world.

## Inspiration for You

I hope this blog becomes more than just a place for my thoughts. If my stories make you think, "So, people like this exist," or "I never thought of it that way," and inspire you, then I've achieved my goal. 

I look forward to adding a unique experience to your everyday life with my stories.
