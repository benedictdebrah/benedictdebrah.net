Hello! I've decided to start blogging about my journey as I transition to a more cloud, DevOps, and AI-focused career. 
Currently, I work as an AI engineer, but I want to deepen my knowledge of cloud development and cloud security and its relation to AI engineering. I believe adding these skills to my expertise will strengthen my career path.  

## How I'm Doing This  

I recently enrolled in a bootcamp by **TechWorld with Nana**, and so far, it's going well. I've completed the prerequisites and introductory courses, and now I'm diving into the fundamentals. My plan is to post weekly updates about:  

- What I’ve learned from the bootcamp  
- Projects I’ve worked on  
- Challenges I’ve faced  
- My overall progress  

## Cloud Certifications Journey  

This month, I also started exploring **AWS Cloud** more seriously. Even though I’ve worked with AWS before, one of my New Year’s resolutions was to earn some cloud certifications.  

I recently completed the **AWS Cloud Essentials** course, which provided a good refresher on AWS products and how they work. However, instead of taking the **Cloud Practitioner** exam, I’ve decided to go for the **GCP** certifications. 
I also have plans on creating an open source communnity around Google cloud platform. I feel this is the best way to learn by sharing and collaboratinng with other like-minded people.



By the end of the year, I aim to:  

- Take the **GCP Cloud engineer** exam
- Finish with my **DevOps bootcamp**  
- Start an open-source community on Google cloud
- Share my learnings and insights through weekly blog posts 



## Why I'm Blogging  

This blog will serve as my personal learning journal. If I ever need to revisit a topic, I can quickly refresh my knowledge by looking at my past posts. It’s also a way to stay consistent and hold myself accountable.  

I’m excited about this journey, and I hope sharing my experiences will help others who are also transitioning into cloud and DevOps. Stay tuned for more updates! 🚀
