Hello! I've decided to start blogging about my journey as I transition to a more cloud, DevOps, and AI-focused career. 
Currently, I work as an AI engineer, but I want to deepen my knowledge of cloud development and cloud security and its relation to AI engineering. I believe adding these skills to my expertise will strengthen my career path.  

## How I'm Doing This  

I recently enrolled in a bootcamp by **TechWorld with Nana**, and so far, it's going well. I've completed the prerequisites and introductory courses, and now I'm diving into the fundamentals. My plan is to post weekly updates about:  

- What Iâ€™ve learned from the bootcamp  
- Projects Iâ€™ve worked on  
- Challenges Iâ€™ve faced  
- My overall progress  

## Cloud Certifications Journey  

This month, I also started exploring **AWS Cloud** more seriously. Even though Iâ€™ve worked with AWS before, one of my New Yearâ€™s resolutions was to earn some cloud certifications.  

I recently completed the **AWS Cloud Essentials** course, which provided a good refresher on AWS products and how they work. However, instead of taking the **Cloud Practitioner** exam, Iâ€™ve decided to go for the **Azure** certifications. 
I also have plans on creating an open source communnity around Google cloud platform. I feel this is the best way to learn by sharing and collaboratinng with other like-minded people.



By the end of the year, I aim to:  

- Take the Microsoft Certified: **Azure Developer Associate & Azure AI Engineer Associate** exam
- Finish with my **DevOps bootcamp**  
- Start contributing to open-source



Iâ€™m excited about this journey, and I hope sharing my experiences will help others who are also transitioning into cloud and DevOps. Stay tuned for more updates! ðŸš€
