Today marks the 3rd day in February.

I remember I wrote about changing my pairs and focusing on XAU/USD.

The good news is I have gotten a proven system that is working, but the bad news is **I am not following the rules.**

I am really stupid.

Recently, I bought a 5K account to trade with, and I am messing it up even though my analysis and setups are on point.

This morning, I sat down to write down the rules in my notes so that anytime I'm about to place a trade, I go through it like my bible.

[My XAU/USD Strategy Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes/0bfE5DoLUnyYnN1nOpSn5wwkQ#991099x__XAUUSD_strategy)

There are some nitty-gritty details left out.

**PS:** This is not financial advice—don’t want to be sued in the future. 😂

I will be back with better news, hopefully. 🤞🏽
