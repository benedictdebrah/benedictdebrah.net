Today, I am making a very difficult decision in my life.

The decision is to remove all my favorite pairs from my watchlist and focus on one pair.

The goal here is to gain a mastery edge on this pair.

**Pairs I am removing:**

1. AUD/JPY
2. CAD/JPY
3. AUD/USD

**Reasons:**

1. They couldn't make me rich. (not logical)
2. Most of their impulsive moves happen during the Asian sessions, and around that time, I'm probably sleeping because I'm tired from work.
3. I think I don’t need more than one pair to be successful. What I need is mastery of one pair, and that’s all.
4. “If nothing changes, nothing changes. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re going to keep getting what you’re getting.” ~ Courtney C. Stevens

**My selected pair now is going to be XAU/USD (GOLD).** I have seen potential in this pair.

I used to trade this pair but often hit SL. However, my analyses are correct too.

**What I am going to work on:**

1. Spend more time on this pair (focus on this and this only).
2. Understand the ins and outs of this pair.
3. Get an edge on this pair.

I promise I will come back with a different story. I do not know when, but my next update on this post will be epic.
