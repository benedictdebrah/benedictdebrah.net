Yeah, so, the market just opened, and I really took an impulsive move to take a trade. 

I actually have no reason why I took that trade. 
Maybe because I wanted to make some money, or maybe I wanted to recover my losses from last week. I ended up losing more money again. I think right now my psychology is messed up. Yeah, I feel my psychology is messed up because at first, I was just doing it for fun. I was just going with the flow, just doing it, having fun with it. But now it's more like I'm stressed about taking a trade. 

I feel I need to take a trade to make some money. I feel I need to take a trade to clear my losses. This will become very difficult for me right now. I'm scared of losing this significant account. Yeah, because the account represents a lot of hard work over two months. 

So, losing it would be very difficult for me to accept. I have about $297 left in this account, and I've decided to stay away from the markets for the whole of this month. So, for the whole of this month, I'm not taking any trade. I'm just going to work on myself, and yeah, I don't know how this mindset of making money just came up, and I'm just messing up my trading plans.
