So, I basically have this feeling about the future of cloud computing, security, AI, data engineering, and everything else in between. I’ve written about such cases on my blog. I don’t even know which article I’ve written—I think I’ve mentioned some of these things over there. How the future is going to change with cloud computing and DevOps. And the reason why I’m entering into DevOps and cloud computing at the moment.

### Why Not AWS?

So the difference... some of my reasons...... why is it that  I don’t try to focus on AWS, since AWS has the market-leading share and the rest are trying to catch up?

The reason why I’m not choosing AWS is that there are **a lot of people in AWS**. A lot of people, a lot of courses, a lot of projects have already been done with AWS. And one reason is, AWS came into this thing before these other cloud platforms. So it was adopted first, based on what I know from my research.

With the emergence of these new cloud platforms—**Azure and Google Cloud**—most companies were already with AWS, and some of the problems that were faced by cloud computing platforms, AWS had already solved. That’s one of the reasons why most companies moved to AWS—because it had a lot of services during that time too.

### The Current Landscape

But currently, we’re in a situation where these three companies are trying to compete with each other. And from my research, **the growth of AWS has been declining**. Even though they still have the biggest market share, it’s been going down.

We also know that Google has the habit of abandoning projects, but **Google Cloud Platform is one of the projects that Google will not abandon**—because of the number of investments they’ve made into it. 

As you know, if Google has a project and they see a future in it, they do whatever it takes to hold the project down. and look at the acquisition they made recently with **Wix**. That’s one of their biggest acquisitions, and it’s for the **security of the cloud platform**, meaning they have a realistic future planned for Google Cloud.

### My Local Perspective

And in my place, where I find myself—that’s in **Ghana**—most people are into AWS, AWS, AWS. And one thing about me is, I don’t like it when a lot of people are crowded in one particular place. It’s a bad sign. So you just have to find a good place and **be a master of that field**. Yeah, that’s it. That’s the best way to make yourself different. Find a good place where it's not overcrowded, and master a particular skill over there.

### My Vision with GCP

I am already in the field of **AI engineering**, and I want to focus on how to add **cloud computing and security** to it. So I have decided to move on with **Google Cloud Platform**. I have some knowledge in AWS—I’ve used it in some projects—but I want to focus more on Google Cloud Platform.

I’ve also started **building a community and a resource project** on Google Cloud Platform, where we’ll be sharing resources, projects, blogs—everything about Google Cloud in the place i find myself. I believe Google Cloud Platform is the next big thing.

Whether you accept it or not, that’s based on how I feel.  Yeah, I might be wrong , but there’s **nothing wrong with gaining knowledge** or learning a new skill. Nah. So I’ll be moving with Google Cloud Platform.

And because of that, I went to Gemini and gave it a prompt to perform a **deep research** on my argument and it actually confirms my opinions.
