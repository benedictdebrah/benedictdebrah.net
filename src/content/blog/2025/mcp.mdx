A couple of days ago, I was on X, reading through some tweets on AI engineering—since that's the field i find myself in, I always try to stay updated on the latest developments. I came across a new concept and tool developed by **Anthropic**, the company behind **Claude**. It's called **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, and from what I understand, it's essentially: 
> a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments

### How MCP Differs from RAG

Before MCP, the typical approach to providing context to models was **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. In RAG, the model retrieves relevant information from a document or database, but this requires embedding the data into vectors for the model to understand. This step adds computational overhead.

MCP, however, operates in **real time**—it directly fetches context without embeddings, making it significantly **faster** and more efficient. This reduces system load and simplifies real-time interactions.

### My Use Case: Real-Time AI News Retrieval

Since I've been working on a news scraper project, I found this concept incredibly useful. One of my biggest frustrations with news websites is the overwhelming number of ads. To solve this, I wrote a script that scrapes news articles into my database, allowing me to filter them based on my interests on that day.

Now, with MCP, I’ve taken it a step further. I integrated it to enable **real-time interactions** with the news database, meaning I can chat with it and get instant updates on topics of interest.


I even made a video demonstrating how it works, and I must say—it’s incredibly impressive.

We’re truly living in the beginning of the future, and MCP opens up **a world of possibilities** for businesses and personal use . You can use it to:

- **Browse websites and generate reports**
- **Automate workflows**
- **Enable real-time AI-powered search**
- **Improve AI-driven applications with minimal system load**

Etc.

Many companies and open source communnity are already building their own MCP integrations, making this technology even more accessible.

This is just the beginning—I’ll definitely be experimenting more with MCP to enhance my automation and AI-driven workflows.

**Exciting times ahead!**
