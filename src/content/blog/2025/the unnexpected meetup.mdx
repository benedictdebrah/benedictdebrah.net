On the 9th of Aprilâ€”I think it was Thursday or soâ€”I received a DM from my manager and mentor asking me if we could meet up in Accra, because he would be leaving the country for a month or so.  
So yeah, I had no serious plans, and it was just the works that he had assigned to me.

Got to meet him on Friday and it was just vibes. Also met a colleague over thereâ€”heâ€™s actually the UI/UX designer. Theyâ€™re working on v3 for the Soccersm platform.

It gave me the chance to relax, and we went to eat fufu and some hot light soup. It really matched the hype.  
So after eating, we started working by showing him all the work I had been able to do over the past weeks and the problems I had been running into.
Had some discussions on my thought process and why? figuring thngs out together and i must say it was really interesting.
I wish work was like this everydayðŸ˜‚

Also this man just looked at the codes and was able to point out some good recommendations I never thought of. It was pretty good, and I made changes to it and made some pushes. There were some unfinished tasks to do, but I was very tired, so we went out and he got me some meat and drinks.  
I was already full with the fufu that we ate, so no bingy dryness.

Before sleeping, the community manager of the hub we were staying at came to ask me if I would be going for the trip, and I was like, yeahâ€”but I didnâ€™t know where they were going. But I knew my manager was going, so yeah...

Next day, we set off. Got the chance to meet some tech guys and founders of startups, and I must say I was really impressed.  
But there was one thing that made me realise something that was on social mediaâ€”they were all keen on creating content on social media: taking pictures, videos, retweeting, etc.

I took some pictures, probably on my homepage (Peduase Valley, Zoo, Aburi Gardens, Asenema Waterfalls).

Overall, it was a nice experience.  
One thing I took from that place was social mediaâ€”letâ€™s forget about the work and bugs that I went there to fix.

I feel itâ€™s very necessary to have social media presence.  
I was just happy at how different people from different jurisdictions were interacting as if they had known each other for a very long time. And most of them were Web3.  
I donâ€™t do Web3, and I donâ€™t believe in Web3.  
Maybe one day I will share my opinions on it.

I think itâ€™s about time we take our social media presence seriously. Others are making a living out of it.

It doesnâ€™t have to be what everyone is doing, but just be you.  
Share your works, your opinions, etc.  
Who knowsâ€”you might get to see or know someone who is exactly weird like you.
