I'm back again with both good and bad news.

Recently, I’ve noticed something about my trading. Previously, my issue was not following my rules, but I’ve really tried to stay disciplined, and I must say it's been going well.

The bad news? I don’t wait for my trades to fully materialize. I end up taking profits too early!

It’s really painful because, in this setup, I only took 120 pips, even though I caught it right from the start.

### The Plan:

I’ll be adding this to my rules, and as always, I must follow them:

1. For every trade, I must determine whether it’s a **1:1 trade** or a **swing trade** before entering.
2. If it’s a **swing trade**, I will completely forget about it—either it hits **SL** (Stop Loss) or **TP** (Take Profit).
3. If it’s a **1:1 trade**, I will take profit at the end of it.

### Changes to Habits:

1. Disabled all social media for now (except **Slack** for work and **Telegram** for storage).
2. My focus is now limited to three things: **Work, Trading, and Learning**.
