Lately, I’ve realized that I tend to do things randomly. When I plan ahead, I execute tasks efficiently, but when I act without structure, my time management suffers. Writing this post is my way of holding myself accountable—if I write it down, I’m more likely to follow through.  

## Learning About Scheduling  

A friend, Peniel, introduced me to the idea of structured scheduling. One day, he asked me:  

> _"Benedict, What task will i be working on so that i can plan for next week?"_  


I was confused and replied, _"What do you mean?"_  

He explained that he plans out his week in advance, deciding what he’ll do each day. I found that really inspiring and decided to try it myself—but in a way that works for me.  

Instead of a rigid schedule, I want something structured but **flexible enough** to adapt when needed.  


Rather than setting exact times for everything, I’m structuring my day into **blocks of time** to allow for variation while still maintaining focus.  

### **🌅 Morning Start (4:00 AM - 8:00 AM)**
- Wake up around **4:00 - 5:00 AM** (depending on how I feel)
- Workout (jogging or light exercise) i have to (feeling timid recently)
- Quick morning prep: shower, plan the day, and refresh  
- Read a book or listen to a podcast  
- Have breakfast & ease into the day  

### **💻 Work & Learning (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM)**
- Start work around **9 AM** (earlier or later depending on the day)  
- Focused work session (coding, projects, meetings)  
- **2 hours** of dedicated learning (technical skills, new topics)  
- Take a break for something new or creative  

### **☀️ Afternoon Recharge (3:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**
- Step away from the screen, take a break  
- Go for a walk, meet friends, or just relax  
- **Optional:** Work on personal projects if feeling productive  

### **🌙 Evening Wind Down (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)**
- Light work, journaling, or reflection  
- Entertainment or social time (movies, games, or chatting with friends)  
- **Plan for the next day** (but keep it simple!)  
- Sleep by **10:00 - 11:00 PM** (depending on how the day went)

## **Planning Without Pressure**  

Instead of setting strict deadlines, I’ll use **Microsoft To-Do** to track **4-5 key tasks** daily. That way, I stay productive without feeling overwhelmed.

The goal isn’t to **force** a routine but to **create a flow** that helps me manage time better while allowing for flexibility. 

I did this with the help of AI , looked through it and its looks good.
