## Lessons from My Recent Trading Experience

I feel like writing this down because I forgot to post about it. So, I passed my PropFirm account around the end of Marchâ€”probably on the 25th or 26th. Yeah. I basically started trading last week. After getting the accounts, I was very eager to make some profits, but I ended up making losses. I recovered and made about $300. Yeah, around $300 on the PropFirm accountâ€”the $5K account.

Looking back, I think the smart thing to do would have been to just wait for payouts and take them. Or at least manage my risk properly, just like I had been doing over the past month when I was passing the challenge. But instead, I was trying to force profits. 

From my calculations, risking $150 per trade, will make me around $1.7K. Risking $300 per trade could have given me about $3K. But you see how unreasonable and stupid I am at the moment?ðŸ˜‚ cos of greed. I basically lost every profit I made on my funded accounts, and now Iâ€™m even in a $100 drawdown.

After taking that loss, I realized somethingâ€”I was being greedy. I wasnâ€™t following a plan. I wasnâ€™t sticking to a strategy. I think overconfidence played a part too. I called my best friend and told him everything. The funny thing? He had made the same mistake last year. He passed an account, but instead of staying disciplined and making a withdrawal, he ended up blowing it. 

Luckily, I havenâ€™t blown mineâ€”Iâ€™ve just made some losses. But man, I havenâ€™t felt this bad about trading in a long time. When I lost money on my real accounts before, it seriously affected my capital. And now, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m repeating the same cycle.

I think the only solution is to stick to the plan. My confidence is getting ahead of me, and Iâ€™m being undisciplined. I see the greed in my decisions. I worked hard to get to this stage, but now, instead of maintaining my strategy and plan, Iâ€™m basically gambling. Thatâ€™s not tradingâ€”itâ€™s gambling. Trying to make big money in 10-15 minutes isnâ€™t trading. I should have known better.

The worst part? I also shared a signal. So, itâ€™s not just my lossâ€”others who followed me also lost money. I feel bad about that, even more than my own loss. Week after week, weâ€™ve been winning, but this week was different. And it sucks. It really does.

So, why am I writing this? Because I know that when I put things into words, I follow through. Writing it down keeps me accountable. Moving forward, Iâ€™m going to stick to my trading plan, stay disciplined, and not be greedy. Thatâ€™s the main thingâ€”I wonâ€™t be greedy.

This week, I probably wonâ€™t trade at all. Next week, Iâ€™ll focus on taking only A+ trades and seeing if I can recover the account. Even if I only manage to withdraw $50, Iâ€™ll take itâ€”because I need to pay for the mistake I made.

But as I always sayâ€”Iâ€™m coming back. And thatâ€™s the good news.
