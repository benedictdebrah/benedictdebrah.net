So i basically recorded everything here with a tool i wrote just to speed up the process of writing.
You know speaking is way faster than typing, so i just recorded everything and transcribed it. I think this is a good way to get my thoughts out there without spending too much time on it. I hope you find it helpful.
( will probably take this in less than 10 hrs a bit too personal for me to share but i think it will be worth it in the end. I will probably take this down after a while so if you are reading this, you are lucky. I am not sure how long i will keep this up. I just want to get my thoughts out there and see what happens. I hope you enjoy it and find it helpful. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me. Thanks for reading! )
## The "Bullshit" They Don't Tell You: My Take on Life, Love, and Why Men Should Act Like the Prize

It hit me recently, this whole back-and-forth of emotions I've been navigating, talking to guys, chatting with friends. There's this undercurrent in life, something a lot of people don't really spell out for you. You're living in a world where so much feels…infringed. People subtly (or not so subtly) push you towards paths that suit them, all disguised as "doing the right thing."

But as you grow, as your mind starts to carve its own way, you realize a lot of that is, frankly, bullshit. Seriously, all that noise about constantly prioritizing others when you're not even happy yourself? It doesn't make sense. We see people bending over backwards for validation, achieving things just to get a nod of approval. If your good deeds are fueled by a need for praise instead of genuine inner satisfaction, then I promise you, it's energy wasted.

I'm starting to believe in being selfish – selfish for yourself. It sounds harsh, but good people, the truly kind ones, often get used. I saw it myself when I posted "Be good, your reward is in heaven." Almost every comment pushed back, saying it wasn't true, that good people just get taken advantage of. And honestly, based on what I've seen, they're right. So yeah, be selfish. Put yourself first. Keep your circle tight. There's so much more to say on this, but the core is: think about you. Truly think about you. No one cares as much as you think they do. The person who *really* did probably isn't around anymore.

Now, let me drop a little hack I've learned. This is about those critical years, roughly from 17 to maybe 26 or 27. I call it the "deadliest" period because what you do (or don't do) then can set your trajectory for life. This is the time to hyper-focus on your craft. Whatever you're good at – singing, trading, coding, whatever – master it. Grind. This isn't the time for excessive partying or chasing fleeting pleasures.

Don't get me wrong, we all goof off sometimes, do things that don't necessarily serve our long-term goals. But this period is about serious self-investment. It's also when you start meeting your tribe, people on a similar mission. And here's another thing I've noticed: good friendships and relationships aren't forced. They just happen. The most meaningful connections in my life came out of nowhere, a natural alignment of energy.

Also, ditch the idea of "friends for life" as a guaranteed thing. People come and go. Don't let a friendship ending or a relationship break-up shatter you and prevent you from moving forward. Don't get stuck in the past.

Yeah, and you know what else? I used to always look outward, searching for relationships and close connections in new faces. But lately, I've been realizing something pretty obvious: sometimes the people you're looking for are right there beside you. Look to your right, look to your left. There might be a woman who's been a constant in your life all along, someone you never considered "the one," but who has been showing you all the signs. Stop wasting time trying to force connections. It's honestly a drain. Instead, appreciate the people who are already in your corner and try to bring them joy. There's a real happiness that comes from being able to do something nice for your old friends when you come back home. Whether it's a night out, helping them out financially, whatever it is – that feeling of making them happy genuinely brings me joy. I even remember this one time, someone was trying to talk negatively about me, and a friend from our circle immediately shut it down. He was like, "You're lying, Benedict isn't like that. Benedict's the kind of guy who, when you're with him, he'll make sure everyone feels good, especially if we're out and about – he's the one who'll take care of things." I didn't even realize people were taking notice of those things I do. It just goes to show, people are watching, they're observing your life.

And speaking of relationships, let's talk about a dynamic I've observed. I'm 22 right now, and a girl of the same age? She's in her prime. But for guys, I don't think we hit our prime until maybe 27, 28, even 30. That's when more options and opportunities tend to open up. It sounds controversial, but hear me out.

Think about it. Why is it that women in their early twenties have so much attention? All the "big men," the "good guys," seem accessible to them. But as they approach 30, that attention often shifts. It's like they've reached a peak. Meanwhile, a guy at 22, if he hasn't really built anything yet, still has time. But if he reaches his late twenties or thirties without any solid foundation, he might spend those years meant for enjoyment playing catch-up.

This leads me to this core thought: **men are the prize.**

Ask yourself: why do women in their twenties get all the attention, all the access to desirable partners? But as they hit 30, that tends to decline. It's like their peak has passed, and the spotlight moves to the younger generation. During those prime years for women (around 21-27), men are often the main characters, the ones being sought after.

Now, if you're a guy in your early to mid-twenties and you haven't started building your life, you need to understand that you're going to have to work hard to compensate for those wasted years later. Those years that should be your prime, when you're attracting what you've always wanted, might be spent playing catch-up.

This is why I think every young guy should understand this. If you're lucky enough to have older mentors who share their experiences, soak it in. Learn from their mistakes. It's funny how we often chase things that don't truly serve us – fleeting relationships, material possessions.

As a guy, especially in your younger years, if you're heavily focused on chasing a particular girl before you're even close to being 50% fulfilled in your own purpose, I think it's a misallocation of energy. Women in their prime often look for the highest bidder, and their prime is relatively short compared to ours. A guy can get his career on track at 40 and still attract the woman he desires, provided he has the resources. But it's arguably tougher for a woman to have the same kind of pull at 40 or 50, even with financial success. You don't see Jennifer Lopez easily getting with a Michael B. Jordan, but a Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson could likely attract a Rihanna or a SZA. That's why I don't necessarily blame women for going for the "highest bidder" during their prime; it's a limited window.

Going back to my earlier point about being selfish – yeah, be selfish. But understand that selfishness isn't black and white. There are different ways to be selfish. It could mean solely focusing on yourself, or it could mean prioritizing yourself alongside your siblings, your family. It really depends on your definition. I know, it might sound a bit strange, which is why I sometimes hesitate to talk about these things too much. It can feel like I'm trying to give off a certain "vibe." But yeah, this world is a wild ride. And those people who are constantly turning down good opportunities in relationships or friendships? They might be the ones who end up regretting it, especially if those people have consistently proven their worth. So, what are you waiting for?

So i have  point out some mistakes made by women during their prime can have lasting consequences, potentially affecting their ability to find a good partner later in life. I acknowledged the pain of losing good people in life, a universal experience that can be difficult to overcome. Maybe one day, I'll dive deeper into some personal stuff that's happened in my life. Perhaps start a podcast or hop on other platforms to just talk about the realities of being a young guy. I don't know how feasible that is yet, but we'll see. I've been thinking about reflecting on my year one experiences, things that really impacted me. Actually, most of you have probably been through something similar. For me, 2022 was a year I'll never forget; it really messed with me and my academics. I think every guy needs to experience that kind of "looking at" – facing adversity head-on. Because once you've been through something like that, anything else that comes your way? It's nothing new. You just take it on the chin and move forward. Yeah, 2022… that was something else. There's a lot to unpack there, but we'll leave it for another time. Honestly, sometimes I'm just tired. I can see a whole scenario play out with someone, and I might just decide to go along with it, just for the thrill of seeing how it ends. It's like rewatching your favorite TV show – you know what's going to happen, but it's still kind of fun.

So, my final thoughts: for the girls reading this, remember your past choices shape your future. And for the guys? Your future is what truly matters. Act like the prize, because you are. And one last piece of advice, especially for the ladies reading this – **be careful of your past. That's the biggest piece of advice I'll give to any woman I care about, to my sisters.**
