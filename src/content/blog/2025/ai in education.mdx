Hello! Today, i feel like talking about AI. where we are now, and what’s ahead. I’ll be focusing on specific domains, sharing my perspective on what I know and what I think is going to happen. If I’m not familiar with a particular domain, I won’t be discussing it.
We all know AI is an assistive technology. AI stands for artificial intelligence, and it helps perform tasks that don’t necessarily require human intelligence. While AI itself is not a new concept, every technology has a moment when it gains widespread attention. Right now, we’re in a phase where AI is evolving rapidly, and companies everywhere are adapting to these changes. Eventually, AI will become an integrated part of our daily lives—it won’t feel like something foreign or separate from us.
A common concern we hear in the media is that AI will take away jobs. The reality is that AI will replace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. I’ll come back to the topic of job displacement and job creation later. For now, let’s talk about AI in education.
AI in Education


I remember when ChatGPT was released in 2022 or 2023. Before that, if we had assignments in school, we’d search for answers manually—using Google, Stack Overflow, blogs, and other resources. Sometimes, we’d even rely on platforms like Chegg, though access often required a paid subscription. This manual process forced us to research, understand the concepts, and truly learn before submitting our assignments.
Once ChatGPT became available, everything changed. Now, students can simply input a question and receive a complete answer instantly. While this advancement has made education more efficient, it also comes with drawbacks.
One major downside is that AI reduces the need for critical thinking. We often focus on getting tasks done quickly rather than actually learning the material. I’ve personally experienced this. I used to rely on ChatGPT a lot, and while it helped in many ways, I also noticed that it made me think less. I’ve asked my colleagues about this, and they’ve had similar experiences.
For example, instead of sitting down to write something from scratch, we can now provide a brief prompt, let AI generate content, make a few edits, and call it done. This ease of use is convenient, but it also weakens our problem-solving skills.
That said, AI in education isn’t all bad.

One significant benefit is that it makes tasks easier and more accessible. As I write this blog, I’m using AI to transcribe my speech into text. Instead of typing everything manually, I’m speaking, and the AI is handling the writing. This is a perfect example of how AI enhances productivity.
In the future, AI will be as integral to education as calculators are in math classes. Just as calculators became standard tools in high school and college, AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others will become standard educational aids. In fact, some PhD students already use ChatGPT’s premium version for their research.
Ultimately, it’s important to learn how to use AI effectively in education—not as a shortcut to avoid thinking, but as a tool to enhance learning. AI-powered tutoring systems can help students interact with complex subjects, providing instant feedback and explanations.
This is just the beginning of AI’s role in education, and as we continue to integrate it into our learning systems, we must find a balance between convenience and intellectual growth.

But honestly I am scared of for the future with regards to ai in education . How are we supposed to be better if we are not thinking enough 

My next post in relation to this will be AI on Jobs
