# Getting Started with Technical Notes

Welcome to my technical notes section! This is where I document:

- **Code snippets** and solutions
- **Technical learnings** and insights
- **Quick references** for common problems
- **Architecture decisions** and patterns
- **Tool configurations** and setups

## Features

This notes section includes:

- **Tag filtering** - Filter notes by tags
- **Search functionality** - Search through all notes
- **Sorting options** - Sort by date or title
- **Category organization** - Organize notes by category

## Example Code Block

Here's an example of how code looks in notes:

```javascript
function example() {
    console.log("This is a code example!");
    return true;
}
```

Feel free to explore and use these notes as a reference!
